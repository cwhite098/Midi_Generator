# Midi_Generator

This project uses an LSTM to generate midi files of jazz solos.

## Aims
Use what I learnt generating lyrics using an LSTM and apply it to a more complex scenario.  
Learn how to parse and manipulate .midi files in python.  
Train two networks to predict both the notes and the durations of them.

## Technology
Python 3.8,
PyTorch,  
Music21,  
Jupyter Notebooks,  
Pickle


## Usage
Unzip the dataset folder (Jazz_Midi.zip),
Run the code in the Jupyter notebook, commenting and uncommenting the relavant code to either retrain the supplied networks or load them.

## Example Output

[song1](/untitled.mp3)
[song2](/untitled2.mp3)
